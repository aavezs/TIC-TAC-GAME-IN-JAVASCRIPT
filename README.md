In this project, I've developed a fully-functional Tic Tac Toe game that pits two players against each other in a battle of strategy and wit. Players take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O') with the objective of achieving a winning combination.

Key features include:
ðŸ”¹ Interactive gameplay with click functionality for seamless moves
ðŸ”¹ Win detection algorithm to determine the victor
ðŸ”¹ Reset button for easy game restarts
ðŸ”¹ Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices
